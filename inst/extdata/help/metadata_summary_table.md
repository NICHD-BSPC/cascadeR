#### Summary Table
------------------

Visualize the distribution of cells across different metadata categories using interactive tables.

### Features

- **Cross-tabulation**: Shows cell counts or proportions across two metadata variables
- **Interactive tables**: Sort and filter to focus on specific relationships

### Controls

- **Value type**: Choose between:
  - `proportion`: Show percentages instead of raw counts
  - `count`: Show absolute number of cells
- **Proportion w.r.t.**: When using proportions, calculate with respect to:
  - `Group by`: Proportions sum to 100% within each group
  - `Split by`: Proportions sum to 100% within each split category
- **Refresh**: Update the table after changing settings

### Usage

- Compare cell type distributions across samples
- Identify sample-specific cell populations
- Validate batch effects or integration quality
- Explore relationships between clustering solutions

### Export Options

- Tables can be downloaded as CSV files
