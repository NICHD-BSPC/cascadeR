### Single Cluster Tree
-----------------------

Visualizes a single cell clustering as a hierarchical tree where similar clusters are placed closer together based on gene expression profiles.

#### Features

- **Hierarchical view**: Shows relationships between clusters based on gene expression similarity
- **Dendrogram visualization**: Clusters with similar expression profiles appear closer together
- **Customizable orientation**: Tree can be displayed in different directions
- **Adjustable text**: Control text size for better readability

#### Controls

- **Clustering column**: Metadata column to use for cluster grouping
- **Tree direction**: Choose orientation of the clustering tree (default: `rightwards`)
  - Options: `rightwards`, `downwards`, `upwards`, `leftwards`
- **Text scale**: Adjust the size of cluster labels
- **Generate plot**: Click to create or update the visualization

#### Usage

- Identify relationships between cell clusters
- Discover hierarchical structure in your cell populations
- Determine which clusters are most similar to each other
- Validate biological relevance of clustering results

#### Export Options

- Click the `Download` button to save the current plot to PDF
- Edit plot dimensions and image resolution in the popup dialog
