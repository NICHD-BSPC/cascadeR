\title{Get counts table based on coexpression}
\usage{
get_coexp_tbl(
  df,
  genes,
  n = 100,
  threshold1 = 0.5,
  threshold2 = 0.5,
  bin_mode = "range"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame with gene expression data}

\item{genes}{genes to calculate coexpression for}

\item{n}{number of bins}

\item{threshold1}{percentile to define expression for gene 1}

\item{threshold2}{percentile to define expression for gene 2}

\item{bin_mode}{how to bin? can be 'range' (gene expression binned into
n bins) or 'quantile' (cells binned into n bins by exp)}
}
\value{
data.frame with co-expression counts
}
\description{
Get data frame with counts of cells
binned into four categories based on expression of
two genes
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item both genes low
\item gene A low, gene B high
\item gene A high, gene B low
\item gene A high, gene B high
